Public Deployments

Roku Channel Submission is very similar to submitting to Apple or Google Play stores. You provide:
- Channel Name & Description
- Screenshots - created through the web interface, under Utilities
- Signed package file

Roku will then review public channels for correctness and appropriateness.  They have content guidelines... familiarize yourself with them!
