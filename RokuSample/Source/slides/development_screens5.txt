User Input

After Show()ing a screen, you will want to wait for user input.  This is done with a message loop. (For those of us who are older than JavaScript, this may look familiar)

	While True 
		message = wait(0, messagePort)

		If message.IsScreenClosed() Then
			Return
		Else
			' React to other types of user input
		End If
	End While
