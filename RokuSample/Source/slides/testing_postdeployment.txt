What happens on deployment?

- The Roku examines the Manifest file and creates an icon for your channel
- The Roku compiles all the BrightScript in your zip file. This will catch gross syntax errors, but will not do things like compare types.
- If the compilation fails, your channel's icon will not appear, but a (usually unhelpful) error will be written to the debugger.
- Assuming compilation succeeds, the Roku will start your Channel and you can start interacting.
