Configuring a Screen

- Each screen type is configured differently, but for there is usually a method that takes an Associative Array (for detail screens) or an Array of Associative Arrays (for list screens).
- The items expected in the Associative Array vary by screen type, but a roPosterScreen, for example, expects an Array of Associative Arrays which can include the following elements:
ShortDescriptionLine1 & ShortDescriptionLine2 - Text descriptions of the item
SDPosterUrl & HDPosterUrl - Low and high-res images. Aspect ratio and expected size are determined by the screen's style.
- After creating the array, it is configured into the screen using screen.SetContentList(...)
- Screens like roParagraphScreen and roPosterScreen are configured more directly with discrete method calls.
