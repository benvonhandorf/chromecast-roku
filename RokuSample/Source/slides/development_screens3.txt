Configuring a Screen

- (Usually) Configured via an associative array or array of associative arrays.
- Expected elements vary by screen type, e.g. for roPosterScreen
ShortDescriptionLine1 & ShortDescriptionLine2 - Text descriptions of the item
SDPosterUrl & HDPosterUrl - Low and high-res images. Aspect ratio and expected size are determined by the screen's style.
- After creating the array, it is configured into the screen using screen.SetContentList(...)
- Screens like roParagraphScreen and roSearchScreen are configured more directly with discrete method calls.
