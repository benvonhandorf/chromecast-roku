Program Flow

- When the Channel is started, Sub Main() will be called.

- The splash screen will be displayed until the first screen is displayed, so this is a great opportunity to pre-cache resources or hit APIs for startup data.

- Side Note: All Roku Channels are single-threaded, so if you pass up this opportunity to pre-cache resources, your program will wind up pausing later while you make your network calls.
