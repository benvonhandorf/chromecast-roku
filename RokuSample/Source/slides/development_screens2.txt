Creating a Screen

- A screen is created by calling CreateObject.
- You must associate it with the roMessagePort object you want to use if you want to react to user input in any way.

  messagePort = CreateObject("roMessagePort")
  screen = CreateObject("roPosterScreen")

  screen.SetMessagePort(messagePort)
