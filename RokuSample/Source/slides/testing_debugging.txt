Debugging

The Roku actually has a fairly powerful debugging environment built in.  To access it:
Telnet to your Roku's IP address on port 8085
Basic commands:
   Execution will stop when an error occurs or with CTRL-C
   Any valid BrightScript command can be run here, including variable assignment.
   Print will show the value of an expression
   bt (Backtrace) will show the call stack to this point
   var will show local variables
   step will execute the next statement
   Cont (or c) will continue program execution
