Show the Screen

The screen will not be displayed until screen.Show() is called.  You may also need to re-call screen.Show() if you change elements on the screen (e.g. adding or removing buttons).

	screen.Show()

- After Show()ing a screen, you will want to wait for user input.  This is done with a message loop. (For those of us who are older than JavaScript, this may look familiar)
