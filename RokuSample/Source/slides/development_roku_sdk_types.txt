Roku SDK Types

- All Roku SDK types start with "ro", for example "roParagraphScreen".

- These types then implement one or more interfaces that define their functionality. In most cases, they will implement an interface named the same as the type, e.g. "ifParagraphScreen".  

- When looking at the documentation, all methods are defined at the interface level. More general documentation is at the type level.
