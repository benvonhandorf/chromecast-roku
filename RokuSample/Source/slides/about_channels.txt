What is a Channel?

- A Channel is a small app that is downloaded to the individual Roku boxes and runs there.

- Channels are (usually) associated with a content provider like Netflix, Hulu, HBO, etc.  

- Channels are self-contained and do not communicate with each other or share content.

- Channels CAN co-operate with mobile applications (using the External Control Protocol), but this is not common.
