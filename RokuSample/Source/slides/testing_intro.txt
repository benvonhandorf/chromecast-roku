How do we test our Channel?

- Every Roku can serve as a development box, but first you have to enter the secret code.  Using the Roku remote (not a smartphone app):
- Home, Home, Home, Up, Up, Right, Left, Right, Left, Right 
- Pick a password for your roku development.  You can always reset this password using the Rokunami Code above.
- You can then deploy your Channel ZIP file to the Roku using any web browser.  You can find the Roku's IP address in the Settings/Player Info screen on the device.
